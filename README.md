# Shiros Integrations

## Description

Its an integration Script that makes it easy to replace certain features
in any of Jaksams Scripts at once. Currently only Default Notify and Progressbar 
is supported. But im looking forward to update it and add more integration options.

With 2.0 Extended Drugs were added. Those can only be used with Drugs Creator since
the main purpose of this Script is to make Integration easier.
